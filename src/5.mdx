# CHAPTER 5. FOUNDATIONS FOR INFERENCE
## 5.3 Hypothesis testing for a proportion
### 5.15
#### a)
Null hypothesis H0: The proportion of students whose grades improved is 50%; $p = 0.5$

Alternative hypothesis H1: The proportion of students whose grades improved is not 50%; $p \neq 0.5$
#### b)
Null hypothesis H0: Employees spent on average 15 minutes of company time doing non-business activities in march; $\mu = 0.5$

Alternative hypothesis H1: Employees spent on average more or less than 15 minutes of company time doing non-business activities in march. $\mu \neq 0.5$

### 5.16
#### a)
Null hypothesis H0: The calories consumed haven't changed after they have started being displayed. $\mu = 1100$

Alternative hypothesis H1: The calories consumed are different from before when they weren't displayed. $\mu != 1100$

#### b)
Null hypothesis H0: The fraction of adult residents that consume alcohol is the national average 70%. $p = 0.7$

Alternative hypothesis H1: The fraction of adult residents that consume alcohol is different from the national average of 70%. $p \neq 0.7$

### 5.17
The null hypothesis H0 should be: $p = 0.6$ and the alternative hypothesis should be $p \neq 0.6$.
Note that the proposed statements are about the sample proportion but we are interested in hypotheses about the population proportions.

### 5.18
The null hypothesis H0 should be $p = 0.25$ and the alternative hypothesis H1 should be $p \neq 0.25$.
Note that we assume the study is valid and try to disprove it with our sample, not the other way around.
Furthermore as in exercise 5.17 the statements are about population proportion not sample proportion.

### 5.19
a) Yes, the claim is supported by the confidence interval.  The (54%,64%) confidence interval implies that we are 95% confident
that at least 54% of the population has been cyber-bullied.
b) No, this claim is not supported by the confidence interval. It is unlikely that 70% experienced cyber-bullying.
c) No, 90% confidence interval is narrower.
