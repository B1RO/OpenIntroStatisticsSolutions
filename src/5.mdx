## 5.3 Hypothesis testing for a proportion
### 5.15
#### a)
Null hypothesis H0: The proportion of students whose grades improved is 50%; $p = 0.5$

Alternative hypothesis H1: The proportion of students whose grades improved is not 50%; $p != 0.5$
#### b)
Null hypothesis H0: Employees spent on average 15 minutes of company time doing non-business activities in march; $\mu = 0.5$

Alternative hypothesis H1: Employees spent on average more or less than 15 minutes of company time doing non-business activities in march. $\mu != 0.5$

### 5.16
#### a)
Null hypothesis H0: The calories consumed haven't changed after they have started being displayed. $\mu = 1100$

Alternative hypothesis H1: The calories consumed are different from before when they weren't displayed. $\mu != 1100$

#### b)
Null hypothesis H0: The fraction of adult residents that consume alcohol is the national average 70%. $p = 0.7$

Alternative hypothesis H1: The fraction of adult residents that consume alcohol is different from the national average of 70%. $p != 0.7$
